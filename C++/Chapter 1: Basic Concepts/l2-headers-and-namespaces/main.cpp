#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Headers
        // C++ offers various headers, each of which contain information needed for programs to function properly. You've already seen the iostream header

    // Example
    /*
    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        std::cout << "Hello World!\n"
        return 0;
    }
    */

        // #include is used for adding standard or user-defined header files to the program
            // The iostream header file defines standard stream objects that input and output data

    // Namespaces
        // A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (name of elements) inside it. In previous code I left out, the line
        //  "using namespace std" tells the compiler to use the std namespace
            // Try not to use "using namespace" commands, it often causes naming conflicts when the name of a function/member of a library has the same name of another
