## My collection of examples and comments from Sololearn.com's courses

This is a dumping place for all the code examples and comments I copy down from Sololearn's coding courses. Taking notes and writing examples myself made it much easier to understand how each example worked

Take a look at [sololearn.com's](www.sololearn.com) programming courses, they're pretty comprehensive
